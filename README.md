## Purpose

Getting a good job opportunity for students is difficult but is currently being solved by many platforms on the internet. There is no such platform to connect Training and Placement cells of colleges with the companies who want to hire students from colleges. The current scenario looks like all colleges post their placement status on Linkedin for marketing their Training and Placement cell and try reaching the companies.

So, this is our attempt to connect all Training and Placement cells of colleges to companies that want to hire
